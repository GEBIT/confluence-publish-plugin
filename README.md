Confluence Publish Plugin
=========================

Overview
--------

Currently its not possible to write blogs posts with a simple draft workflow.  This means you need to write the entire blog post in one sitting, once you hit publish, it's public.

To work around this limitation its common to create a page with your blog post content then copy it over to a blog post.  This is a manual process that becomes complicated if you have attachments or links in your draft.

This plugin attempts to solve this problem by making it really easy to copy the contents of a page (a draft blog) over to a blog post.  It will copy the content and copy over any attachements to the new blog post.

How
---

The tools menu on the view page view now contains a 'Publish as Blog' menu item (if you have the correct permissions).

This menu item will initiate a copy over to a blog post for your page.
